Project Description:
  A customized shell has been built and designed using lex, yacc and C.
  Lex : Lex part of the program initializes regex definition of the bash
  command line such as ls -al. Based of the matched regex, tokens are
  returned. yylex() is the entry point of the lexiacal analysis of the program.
  
  Yacc: bottom up parsing method has been appiled in the parser to match the
  syntax of the given command line input. Based on the matched grammer, a
  table of commands has been generated to store the commands, options or
  arguments.  THE Executor which is written in C will read from the table and
  exeute the command by using fork(), exec(). The parser is able to handle
  complex program that includes PIPE and file input and output. 

  Future Goal:
    1. Include Buil-in commands support system
    2. Fix issues with redirecting to stderr.
    3. Probably inclue wildcard support.
